    use WebService::Pixela;

    # All WebService::Pixela methods use this token and user name in URI, JSON, etc.
    my $pixela = WebService::Pixela->new(token => "thisissecret", username => "testname");
    print $pixela->username,"\n"; # testname
    print $pixela->token,"\n";    # thisissecret

    $pixela->user->create(); # default agreeTermsOfService and notMinor "yes"
    # or...
    $pixela->user->create(agree_terms_of_service => "yes", not_minor => "no"); # can input agreeTermsOfService and notMinor


    $pixela->user->delete(); # delete method not require arguments
